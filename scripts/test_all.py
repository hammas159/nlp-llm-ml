"""Run every sub-project's test suite and report the total.

    python scripts/test_all.py            # everything
    python scripts/test_all.py projects   # just projects/

This repository is a monorepo of independent packages: each of `projects/*`
has its own `pyproject.toml` and its own `src/`, and each is meant to be
runnable on its own.

Running `pytest` at the repository root does NOT run them, and the way it
fails is worse than not running: the projects share module names. Both
`projects/01_embedding_fair_comparison/src` and
`projects/06_ppmi_svd_vs_sgns/src` contain `evaluate.py`, and
`projects/05_zipf_and_heaps` and `projects/19_sentiment_lexicons` both contain
`corpora.py`. Collected into one session, whichever `src` reaches `sys.path`
first wins, and a test imports a different project's module under the name it
asked for. The visible symptom is an ImportError; the invisible one is a suite
that passes against the wrong code.

So the root `pytest.ini` tells pytest not to descend into them, and this script
is how you run them all. Each suite runs in its own process, from its own
directory, exactly as it would if that package were cloned alone.
